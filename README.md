### Hi, I'm Max 👋

I am a humanities & business graduate passionate about compliance, quantitative research and simulations. 

I love leveraging interdisciplinary knowledge and hyper-international experiences to identify opportunities and develop effective strategies through systematically countering risks. Especially if it involves data!

Currently pursuing a Masters of Business Analytics which brought me here!
